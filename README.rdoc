== README

This is the code challenge for BugCrowd from https://gist.github.com/codesoda/124a85330c10da6785d3.

I primarily used standard rails skeleton tools for the structure of the code.

I was unsure how to approach the Entity Type so it isn't actually integrated into the rest of the code at all.

Normally, there would have been some back and forth about requirements edge cases and the overall purpose behind the code as well.
